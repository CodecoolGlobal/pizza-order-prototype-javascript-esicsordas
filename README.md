## BET Potions
This is a pet project of a website that sells potions, that Codecool students can use in the school. The project aims to mock a website’s core functions.

### Description
This project features a webshop-like webpage created using vanilla JavaScript and Javascript’s Express library. The page allows you to select the amount of potions and add them to your order. You can also set which type of ingredients you want to avoid using the select bar. On the right side, you can enter your data to order.
